# Bibliography

This folder contains the bibliographic information of the scenario references
and the recommended citation of the scenario ensemble and the notebooks
as `ris`, `enl` and `bib` format.

The table `scenario_references.csv` contains the bibliographic details
for all scenarios included in the ensemble and is used by the notebook
`sr15_2.0_categories_indicators` when defining the metadata indicators.
