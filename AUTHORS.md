# Authors

## Authorship of the notebooks

All notebooks were created
by [Daniel Huppmann](https://www.iiasa.ac.at/staff/huppmann)
([@danielhuppmann](https://github.com/danielhuppmann))
in close collaboration with the authors of Chapter 2
of the **IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C**
([Rogelj, Shindell, Jiang, et al., 2018](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/)).

Joeri Rogelj, Elmar Kriegler, Luis Mundaca, Piers Forster, Shigeki Kobayashi,
Roland Séférian, María Virginia Vilariño and other authors of the SR15
contributed to the methodology of the assessment and development of figures
and tables generated by the notebooks.

## Authorship of the scenario ensemble

### Guidelines for authorship of the scenario ensemble

For release 1.0, the IAMC Steering Committee agreed on the following rules 
for the list of authors for the scenario resource:

1) the group of people involved in the collection, vetting,
   and review of the scenario data,
2) all first authors of the studies that submitted scenarios to the ensemble,
3) in case that modelling teams have a limited number of first-authors,
   it is possible to nominate additional authors. In this case, each team can
   nominate one author per study that they contributed to,
   up to a maximum of three authors (ie, under point (2) and (3) each team
   is eligible to a total number of three authors, unless more than three
   first-author studies were submitted by the team).

Following the approval and acceptance of the
[IPCC's Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL)](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/srccl/),
the list of authors was amended to acknowledge the significant contribution
by several authors of the SRCCL regarding the additional analysis and extension
of the scenario ensemble.
